# Reflect API

Reflect API is a microservices-based backend architecture designed for scalable applications requiring robust authentication, efficient logging, and flexible REST APIs. Built with a focus on separation of concerns, it features dedicated services for authentication, business logic, and logging—all communicating via Kafka messaging. With MinIO integration for object storage and PASETO tokens for secure authentication, Reflect API provides a modern, maintainable foundation for building resilient API.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Reflect API is built on a microservices architecture with three main components:

```
/project-root
  /auth-service     # Authentication and authorization
  /main-app         # User and application logic
  /logging-service  # Kafka log consumer
  /shared/proto     # Proto files for gRPC (if used)
  /deployments      # Docker, Kubernetes, or Compose files
```

The services communicate via Kafka messaging, with the logging service consuming messages from both the auth service and main app.

## 🔌 Services

### Main App

The main application serves as the public-facing REST API that exposes various services to users.

**Responsibilities:**
- User-related functionality (CRUD operations, profiles)
- Application-specific logic
- REST API for Posts, Comments, and Users
- Communication with auth-service for authentication via gRPC protocol
- Sending logs to the logging service via Kafka
- Integration with MinIO for object storage
- Utilizing Redis for data caching

### Auth Service

A dedicated service that handles authentication and authorization in a secure, isolated environment.

**Responsibilities:**
- User authentication (login)
- User registration with validation
- Password hashing and security
- PASETO token generation for authentication

### Logging Service

A Kafka-based logging system that captures logs from all other services.

**Responsibilities:**
- Collects logs from different microservices
- Stores logs in Kafka topics for later analysis
- Can be extended to monitoring tools (Prometheus, ELK Stack, etc.)
